      <h2 id="what-i-achieved">What I Achieved</h2>

<p>During my time at sixth form, I studied 3 subjects and passed them all. I studied:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A Level Math</strong> - A*
<!--more--></li>
  <li><strong>AS Level Psychology</strong> - B</li>
  <li><strong>BTEC Level 3 ICT</strong> - D*D</li>
</ul>

<p>With these qualifications I was easily able to secure a place at university, studing the degree of my choice. I chose to study Computer Science (Games Development) at Wolverhampton University.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-a-level">What Is An A Level</h2>

<p>Advanced Level qualifications (A Levels) are a subject-based qualification that can lead to university, further study, training or work. Usually someone studies 3+ A Levels over 2 years of their life.</p>

<p>Advanced Subsidiary Level (AS Level) qualifications represent the first half of an A Level.</p>

<p>There are some other qualification that are equivalent to an A Level, one of those being a Level 3 BTEC (Business and Technology Education Council) qualification.</p>

      <h2 id="you-did-what">You did what?</h2>

<p>Today I used Jekyll for the first time. I used it to publish this website on Github Pages. The experience of learning how to use it was very smooth, and I found it very easy. <!--more-->As is normal for me, however, I struggled setting it up straight away, which led to me getting confused and it taking a couple of hours before I could start actually doing anything interesting.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-use-to-learn-how-to-use-jekyll">What did I use to learn how to use Jekyll?</h2>

<p>Well, it turns out that the people who make it are really good at making tutorials; they have a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">step-by-step guide</a> for how to use it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-jekyll">What is a Jekyll</h2>

<p>Jekyll is a static site generator, which means it makes it easier to turn your thoughts into webpages. It works by putting blog posts into templates. It also offers a system called <em>Liquid</em>, which allows you to inject information like the page title or post date into your code by using the following syntaxâ€¦  <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ page.title }}</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</code> . This system works really well for blogs (which is what it was design for, so that makes sense.)</p>

## What I Achieved

During my time at sixth form, I studied 3 subjects and passed them all. I studied:

- **A Level Math** - A\*
  <!--more-->
- **AS Level Psychology** - B
- **BTEC Level 3 ICT** - D\*D

With these qualifications I was easily able to secure a place at university, studing the degree of my choice. I chose to study Computer Science (Games Development) at Wolverhampton University.

## What Is An A Level

Advanced Level qualifications (A Levels) are a subject-based qualification that can lead to university, further study, training or work. Usually someone studies 3+ A Levels over 2 years of their life.

Advanced Subsidiary Level (AS Level) qualifications represent the first half of an A Level.

There are some other qualification that are equivalent to an A Level, one of those being a Level 3 BTEC (Business and Technology Education Council) qualification.

## Adding Colour to the blog

Today I have come across a nice website called [FlatUIColors][fuic], which is full of really nice colour palettes. So naturally I decided to use one to add colour to this, once greyscale, website. <!--more--> When you navigate to this website, you will find there are different palettes for different countries. I decided to use the GB palette since that is where I am from, and it has a lot of blueish colours which are my favourite.

## How do you use FlatUIColors?

Go to the [website][fuic] and choose a palette. Then you simply click which colour you want to use, and the website copies that colour to your clipboard. Then you go back to your code after hearing a delightful sound, and pate the selected colour into your CSS or what have you. At the top of the page there is a dropdown menu for you to choose which format you would prefer to copy the colour as; the default is the `#RRGGBB` hex pattern.

## My favourite colours

My top 5 favourite colours from the GB Palette on [FlatUIColors][fuic] are:

- <span style="color:#0097e6">**Vanadyl Blue** - #0097e6</span>
- <span style="color:#273c75">**Mizarine Blue** - #273c75</span>

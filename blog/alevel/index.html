        <h2>What i achieved</h2>
        <p>
          During my time at sixth form, I studied 3 subjects and passed them
          all. I studied:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>A Level Math</b> - A*</li>
          <li><b>AS Level Psychology</b> - B</li>
          <li><b>BTEC Level 3 ICT</b> - D*D</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With these qualifications I was easily able to secure a place at
          university, studing the degree of my choice. I chose to study Computer
          Science (Games Development) at
          <a href="https://wlv.ac.uk">Wolverhampton University</a>.

        <h2>What is an A Level</h2>
        <p>
          Advanced Level qualifications (A Levels) are a subject-based
          qualification that can lead to university, further study, training or
          work. Usually someone studies 3+ A Levels over 2 years of their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advanced Subsidiary Level (AS Level) qualifications represent the
          first half of an A Level.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some other qualification that are equivalent to an A Level,
          one of those being a Level 3 BTEC (Business and Technology Education
          Council) qualification.
